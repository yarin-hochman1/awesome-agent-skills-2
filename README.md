## What Are Agent Skills

Agent Skills are modular, standardized `SKILL.md` packages that give agents on-demand capabilities via progressive disclosure: lightweight metadata can load early, full instructions load only when relevant, and supporting resources are accessed when needed.

`agent-skills` · `ai-agents` · `skill-md` · `progressive-disclosure` · `context-management`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are Agent Skills

Agent Skills are modular `SKILL.md` packages that provide on-demand capabilities without loading all knowledge up front.

### How do Agent Skills differ from fine-tuning

Fine-tuning changes model weights, while skills provide runtime knowledge and workflows that you can update instantly.

### What is the difference between Agent Skills and MCP

Agent Skills focus on workflows and capabilities, while MCP focuses on secure, structured data and tool access.

### How do I create my first Agent Skill

See the [How to Build Skills](#how-to-build-skills) section for a step-by-step authoring guide.

### Which AI platforms support Agent Skills

Support varies by platform, but major tools include Claude (Claude.ai and Claude Code), OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, VS Code, and more.

### Can I use Agent Skills with ChatGPT or other LLMs

If a platform does not support the format natively, you can often integrate skills via a loader or by adapting the `SKILL.md` instructions into that platform's prompt workflow.

### Are Agent Skills secure

Treat skills like code: review them before using, avoid installing from untrusted sources, and prefer audited skill libraries.

### How do I share Agent Skills with my team

The most common approach is to version skills in Git (in a shared repo) and let your supported tools discover them from a standard directory.
